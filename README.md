# Random Psalm Verse Generator 

The intention of this simple web application is to fetch a random verse from my favorite book; The Book of Psalms, using the [Bible API](https://bible-api.com/). Clearly displaying the verse in the card and allows users to refesh a new verse with the click of a button.
